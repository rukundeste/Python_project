My name is Oreste RUKUNDO and I am currently a data science fellow at the New York City Data Science Academy.


The Salary prediction is a crucial application of machine learning and statistical modeling that seeks to estimate the salary of an individual based on various factors such as job title, experience, education, location, and other relevant features. Accurate salary predictions are valuable for job seekers, employers, and policy makers as they help in making informed decisions about compensation, budgeting, and career planning. 

I approached this overarching question by analyzing factors  affecting salary predictions and identify key insights to improve the accuracy of salary forecasting.
for job seekers: understanding  the  potential salary ranges can guide career decisions, negotiation strategies, and job selection. For employers can help in setting competitive salaries, planning budgets, and ensuring fairness in compensation and for policy makers can assist in assessing economic conditions, wage inequality, and designing effective labor policies.
In this project I was interested not only in finding out if there is any correlation between salary and other different featuresfactors but also finding out how those different fefactors  are collerated between each other.
